				<h2>Building Lego</h2>
				<p>
					One of the books I've read recently suggested trying to relearn some of the<br>
					hobbies I had when I was a kid. Supposedly it would provide insight into how<br>
					I have grown as a person and could help me find something to be passionate<br>
					about today. To try this, I bought myself a Lego brick set. I chose to build<br>
					Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine.

				<h3>My Experience</h3>
				<p>
					I did enjoy building the Lego Set. It was fun to relearn a hobby I spent so<br>
					much of my youth practicing. That being said, it did not truly feel like a<br>
					creative hobby. I didn't conclude my set feeling like I made something new,<br>
					rather, I felt like I just spent an hour and a half following instructions.<br>
					Perhaps, when I was younger, I would have been fueled by a desire to build<br>
					giant battles between the little toy figures, but today, I merely walked away<br>
					with a cool decoration for a shelf.
				</p>
				<h3>Fun for an adult?</h3>
				<p>
					While the book I read recommended relearning a childhood hobby, I don't feel<br>
					like this experiment was very beneficial for me. I didn't discover any lost<br>
					truths about who I am as a person, or any insights into what I might enjoy<br>
					learning as an adult. Rather, I just found that I didn't enjoy the same things<br>
					I did in my childhood, and that isn't really surprising. Despite that, I am still<br>
					glad I spent the time to re-try something I haven't done in a <i><strong>long</strong></i> time, but my<br>
					hobby search must still continue.
