				<h2>Try new things!</h2>
				<p>
					Life can be repetitive. It can be easy to feel as if you are living the same<br>
					dull week over and over again. I personally often find myself dissapointed with<br>
					how little my life changes from day to day. To combat these dull feelings, I decided<br>
					to try a multitude of hobbbies in hopes that I can find something new I truly enjoy.<br>
					This website is a personal journal containing all the different hobbies I have tried<br>
					this semester. Hopefully I will find something that makes me feel creative, adventurous<br>
					or excited. :)
				</p>
				<h3>Some of the things I have tried so far:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Hiking</u> with friends</li>
					<li><u>Baking</u> sweet treats</li>
					<li><u>Lego</u> models like the ones I had when I was a kid.</li>
					<li><u>Painting</u> scale models with my brother</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I am a mathematics major at ASU and I am on track to graduate this spring. After<br>
					graduation, I hope to continue my education towards a master's degree. I hope to<br>
					someday work as a teaching professor at a university or community college. Currently<br>
					I teach math at a very small private school. That all goes to show that I am a bit of<br>
					a nerd and my dorkiness may be reflected on which hobbies I enjoyed most. Before this<br>
					personal experiment, I enjoyed playing board games and I did enjoy hiking, but not to<br>
					the point where I would consider it a hobby. I absolutely love camping though, hence<br>
					the foresty vibe to my website.
				</p>
				<h3>Feedback?</h3>
				<p>
					If you have any comments or feedback for me, please use the "comments" section. I<br>
					would absolutely love to hear about your favorite hobbies or any other creative <br>
					or adventurous ideas you may have for me. I don't feel content with my journey through<br>
					hobbies yet, so I would love some more new ideas to try. :)
