				<h2>An Old Favorite</h2>
				<p>
					I love hiking. I arguably shouldn't have included it in this journal, but maybe<br>
					exploring one of my all-time favorite hobbies could help me find something new<br>
					and exciting to try. I have been hiking for most of my life. It has been upsettingly<br>
					difficult to find time to hike now that I am a fulltime student with a fulltime job,<br>
					but when I do get a change to hike, I genuinely love it so much. I love having time to<br>
					enjoy the natural world around me and to get lost in my own thoughts with nothing but a<br>
					journey and a destination ahead of me. I also really love getting to see cool new sights,<br>
					so any hike with a landmark at the end is an instant favorite for me. :)

				<h3>Railroad Tunnel Trail</h3>
				<p>
					One of my recent favorite hikes was Railroad Tunnel Trail. This is a short and sweet<br>
					hike in Payson. It was only a couple of miles, relatively flat except for some steep<br>
					hills at the end. The railroad tunnel at the end was a bit dissapointing. It was still<br>
					cool to see but I guess I was hoping it would go a bit deeper. That being said, sometimes<br>
					its about the journey, and not the destination, and the hike to the tunnel was gorgeous.<br>
					I went with a close friend in the middle of June, and the picture on the right shows how<br>
					serene and luscious the environment was. It was so nice to escape the heat of the valley<br>
					and enjoy a beautiful hike in Payson.

				<h3>Crown Jewel and Takeaways</h3>
				<p>
					My "Crown Jewel" of hiking was a roughly 24 mile hike from one rim of the Grand Canyon<br>
					to the other. I felt so accomplished and proud of myself for completing that hike. It<br>
					was hard to enjoy it at the time, especially when comparing it to some of the hikes I<br>
					have done in Payson or Flagstaff. It's hard to enjoy the spectacular view of the canyon<br>
					when the sun is literally melting you. That being said, I brag about this hike all the time.<br>
					Despite the fact that it was not very enjoyable at the time, I loved it because I was proud<br>
					what I accomplished. Therefore, it may be beneficial for me to try and find a creative<br>
					"project-based" hobby. I don't want to be prideful, but I think I want a hobby that will<br>
					allow me to show-off a little bit. I want to find a creative hobby that I can be proud of,<br>
					or maybe another physical hobby like hiking.
