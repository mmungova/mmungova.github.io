				<h2>Cooking Culture</h2>
				<p>
					My final project for my web developement class is supposed to have four pages and a<br>
					home page, so I didn't spend the time to make a journal entry for every hobby I tried.<br>
					That being said, there were a few others I wanted to mention. First, although I<br>
					wouldn't really call it a hobby, some of the books I read reccomended cooking as a way<br>
					to find passion in the day-to-day. I did begin to cook for myself a little bit more<br>
					this semester, as between two jobs and a full-time education at ASU, sometimes it is<br>
					a little too easy to pick-up fast food or to buy a frozen meal. This reccomendation<br>
					was very helpful for me on my journey of hobby exploration. I genuinely loved cooking.<br>
					It combines that creative desire to create something new with life's need to consume,<br>
					and it is so rewarding to create something delicious. While cooking isn't a typical<br>
					hobby, I would highly reccomend home cooking to anyone feeling unfulfilled within their<br>
					day-to-day life, as it has been so rewarding for me to simply spend more time in the kitchen.<br>

				<h2>Concluding Comments</h2>
				<p>
					Below you will find my thoughts on each of the hobbies I wrote about, as well as some<br>
					of the hobbies I didn't get a chance to mention. I elected to note what I liked most<br>
					about each hobby, my biggest complaint with each hobby, and my likeliness to pick up<br>
					the hobby again in the future. The likeliness is ranked on a scale from one to five,<br>
					where one represents a hobby I am very unlikely to continue in the future, and five<br>
					represents a hobby I am very likely to try again someday.

				<p>
					Below you will find a form where you can submit any feedback, questions, comments, or<br>
					reccomendations of future hobbies for me to try. This website has been very personal<br>
					to me this past semester. I feel as if I have really opened up within the words of this<br>
					journal. Therefore, as corny as it is, I would love to hear some genuine comments from<br>
					whoever happens upon this journal. :) Take a moment to open up with me as I have within<br>
					this website. <br>
