				<h2>My Brother's Hobby</h2>
				<p>
					My oldest brother loves board games which use small miniature models. He enjoys a war<br>
					game called Warhammer and a role palying game called Dungeons and Dragons. In my effort<br>
					to try new hobbies, my brother graciously offered to teach me how to paint these miniature<br>
					models. He has some very cooling looking little figures, so I thought it could be fun to<br>
					try painting my own. The image in the bottom right is similar to a figure I tried to paint.<br>
					It is a giant rat-person for the game Warhammer.

				<h3>Slow and Steady</h3>
				<p>
					I don't know if this may be due to my own inexperience painting models, or if I am just<br>
					not patient enough to be a painter, however, I felt like it took me ages to paint this<br>
					model. It is only a couple of inches tall, and yet it was a very time-consuming process<br>
					to paint the model. Additionally, despite my hours spent painting, my figure wasn't nearly<br>
					as nice as the one in the photo. I shouldn't expect my first attempt at a hobby to go well,<br>
					however, my model was particularly ugly despite the long hours spent painting. :)<br>
				</p>
				<h3>Takeaways</h3>
				<p>
					It was very fun to try a hobby with my brother, however, I don't know if this hobby is<br>
					meant for me. To start, painting this model alone was a very expensive process. My<br>
					brother bought a box of around 20 of these rat-people, and the box cost him over $50.<br>
					Adding to that price was the price of brushes, paints, and glue in order to assemble<br>
					the model. This results in a very costly hobby with relatively miniature results.<br>
					This, on top of my issues with patience, makes me hesitant to continue paiting board<br>
					game models, despite the process being pleasantly enjoyable. It was also very<br>
					therapeutic to watch my plastic model come to life with each coat of paint,<br>
					I just don't know if that therapeutic feeling was worth the price we paid.<br>
